# Project Description:

The project is a stopwatch application developed in Flutter. The stopwatch features a simple interface with a button to start or pause the time count. The elapsed time is displayed on the stopwatch screen as text. The application also includes an "About" screen that provides information about the stopwatch, such as the app version, the developer responsible, and the development date.

# Instructions to Compile and Run the Project:

1. Make sure you have Flutter installed on your system. If you haven't installed it yet, follow the instructions in the official Flutter documentation: [https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

2. Copy the provided code and create a new Flutter project.

3. Replace the contents of the `main.dart` file in the new project with the provided code.

4. Ensure that all necessary dependencies, such as `flutter_riverpod`, are included in the project's `pubspec.yaml` file. If needed, run `flutter pub get` to update the dependencies.

5. Now, you can run the project using an emulator or a connected physical device. To do this, use the following command in the terminal:

```
flutter run
```

This will compile and run the application on your emulator or device.

Gabriel da Silva Azevedo was the team member responsible for developing the stopwatch project in Flutter.
